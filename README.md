## Hear No Evil, See No Evil

… “Speak no evil,” the tail end of the phrase leaks from the mumbling mouth of Daniel’s mother, and catches on his impressionable ears. He ponders the words for a moment but his attention is primarily darting from product to product of the wonderful new place he finds himself in. A great big store of some sort, packed to the brim with strange and wonderful products, colorful breakfast cereals, and twelve different and unique types of milk to go with them, hundreds upon hundreds of packages filled with foods and tools and the occasional toy attached haphazardly to the side of a shelf with a little plastic clip. Daniel had never seen a supermarket before, and to him it was a new world. One could say his upbringing had been a bit sheltered.
	And that’s when he saw her. A young girl, his age or no older, sprawled across a mountain of cans as she played dead in an overly dramatic fashion. Her clothes were littered with stains of reds and blues and pinks and more colors than Daniel had seen even on the shelves of the great big store they were in. Tomato sauce trickled from her mouth down her cheek and dribbled slowly off the small cleft of her chin, like blood from her mouth, which had been left agape to signify no words were left in her mangled corpse. She twitched occasionally and made various guttural groans.
	This sight left Daniel quite obviously bewildered. As if completely unfazed by this bizarre sight, Daniel watched as his mother reached up and grabbed a can from just below the strange girl’s head, which then hit the next can in the pile with an audible clunk. His mother moved to the dairy isle.
	Just then, the girl leapt up and off the tower of canisters and began running around with her arms spread wide like wings, shooting puffs of air from her mouth like harmless bullets that struck down her foes. She danced from consumer to consumer, mocking their fat jowls or short dresses, tugging at sleeves and being the most remarkable nuisance one could possibly imagine. And yet, no one even blinked in response. Except, of course, for Daniel.
	When she reached him, now rolling like she was wrapped in a carpet, Daniel began to step away slowly from the girl. The girl stopped in her tracks, her back facing Daniel now as she reached the spot he had once occupied. Daniel stopped too, watching cautiously to see what her next move was.
	Ever so slowly, the girl twisted herself around to face Daniel, still sprawled across the floor with her eyes wide and set on the young boy.
“You can see me?”
	Her voice was quiet and gentle, quite unlike the plethora of sounds she had been throwing at people before her realization that Daniel had eyes. She had a slight British tinge to her voice, and Daniel took note of the golden locks of hair that were not drenched in various store-bought liquids. She was actually quite pretty.
“You can see me!”
	She began shouting now, her eyes wide and wet and blue like the ocean. She leapt up once again and tackled Daniel to the floor, hugging him and rolling around as they impacted the ground.
“My name is Elizabeth! I’m twelve years old and I have a fear of crickets but I love Grasshoppers, and I’ve lived in this store for as long as I can remember but no one has seen me, and I love tomato sauce and pasta but I can only eat it when they put it out on the little taste test carts because I have no one to cook for me, so I usually just eat the tomato sauces straight from the can and today I saw it around my mouth and I thought it was a great opportunity for some theatre, I love theatre too but I’ve never had an audience, imagine never having an audience…”
She went on for quite some time. Daniel simply looked up at her, occasionally grimacing as drops of sauce dribbled onto his face, but otherwise listening contently.
“I thought I was mad.”
Daniel noted the dripping wasn’t sauce anymore. Tears began to fall from her cheeks to his as he began to get over his astonishment and actually feel sympathy for the girl. He held her while she cried and that was how it all started.

Every Tuesday, whenever his mother went shopping, Daniel would insist that he came with her on her shopping trips. He would slip away to Elizabeth’s fortress of tomato sauce cans and his mother would continue on, never noticing his absence. The two youths became fast friends. 
Daniel was quiet, but he could listen to Elizabeth talk for hours without getting bored. She would always listen when he really needed to talk. She was good at telling when he really needed to talk. Probably because she had spent so much time being forced to just watch and listen. Daniel wanted to help.
And so, Daniel would bring her things. Elizabeth was always too scared to leave the store, but with a great deal of convincing and many gifts which told tales of more exciting worlds that lie just beyond the shelves and sliding glass doors, she eventually began to broaden her horizons. Daniel held her hand for every step she took. 

Slowly but steadily, Daniel’s parents began to stop noticing his absence. They would give him less and less warnings, and often not even stop to take note of Daniel’s leaving. Daniel considered it a sign that they were finally letting him grow up, letting him taste the outside world they had spent so much time and effort protecting him from. Still, sometimes Daniel remarked at how they would seem to look through him.
He talked to Elizabeth.
“Hmm. That is an odd occurrence, my dear Watson. Odd indeed, but don’t worry about it too much. We don’t want you to go grey before you’re even a legal adult.”
A good point, but it felt like she was trying to dismiss the subject. He persisted.
“We only have so much time together each week, can’t we just relax and enjoy ourselves a bit? You worry too much, Danny.”
Another good point. Daniel trusted her judgment and dismissed the thought. He liked it when she called him Danny.

Months went by and before he knew it, Daniel was spending more time with Elizabeth than anyone else. His mother and father barely spoke to him anymore, and at one point they even forgot to set his place for dinner. Daniel started setting it himself.
But none of that mattered, because Daniel had Elizabeth. Every day he would go to see her, and every day they would talk about all the things that Daniel had ever kept to himself. Nothing was unsaid between them, save for that one small worry that was stuck on Daniels mind like a fly to a wind shield. He kept thinking more and more about his parents. How little they saw him. Elizabeth kept changing the subject whenever it came up. It was always there. But, things were still good.

	He tore down the road, tears streaming from his face and panic rising from his chest, desperate for the validation he knew only one person could offer. He went to the supermarket.
	When Elizabeth saw him, she ran to his side and cradled his trembling body in her arms, clearly pained to see him in such a state.
	“Jesus, Danny, what’s eating you? You look like you’ve seen a ghost” Daniel didn’t have the strength to speak. So, she just held him for a long time.
“No one can see me anymore.” Elizabeth looked down.
	“You knew this would happen.” Elizabeth closed her eyes.
	“My own parents won’t even think about me. I’m not seen, I’m not heard, I’m not mentioned. It’s like I’ve vanished from existence.” Elizabeth started trembling. She bit her lower lip and shielded her gaze from his face.
“I guess I ran out of time, huh?” Daniel waited. Elizabeth grimaced at the silence, but continued regardless.
“I’m not here. Not really, I died a long time ago.” Still nothing.
“This place is the furthest I got. My farthest boundary, my horizon. I died before I got the chance to go anywhere else, that’s why you…”
She didn’t need to say it. Daniel had never been allowed to explore before this. His parents would viciously protect him from anything alien, anything exciting. Before he met Elizabeth, this was the furthest he had gotten as well. His face softened slightly.
“… It’ll get better once I’m gone. The more time you spend in my world, the closer you get to it yourself. Right now you’re on the cusp. This is your last chance, Daniel. This is the last time you’ll see me.”
Daniel looked at the ground, searching for answers. The cogs in his head were in full swing, tenaciously trying to compute what was happening. These tacky tiles that he had spent so much time with, something familiar in a world of alienation. That which he had craved so fervently, yet seemed so cold and uninviting in his hands. Still, he chose it.
Daniel wrapped his arms around Elizabeth’s shaking shoulders. He cradled in his arms the one that he trusted most and in that moment he felt resolute. He wouldn’t let her go. Elizabeth stood in shock.
“You idiot, what are you doing? You’ve got everything waiting for you, I’m nothing. Leave me be, I’m a bad omen, an evil, incomplete thing!”
He held tighter.
	“God damn it!”
	Elizabeth pounded his back and attempted to pry him from herself to no avail. She writhed and reasoned and raged against his affection, but every strike only tightened his embrace. For the first time in her life, Elizabeth was happy that someone saw through her. All that remained was a smile.
	“Are you sure?”
	Her voice was just as gentle as the first time. Daniel just nodded into her shoulder, and in that moment, Elizabeth finally felt content.
	“Thank you. Live your life. You gave me mine.”
